<ol type="I">
    <li> <h2>Find Your Motivation. As with anything in life, it's important to play Esports for the right reasons.</h2></li>
    <li> <h2>Pick Your Game. The next step is to find your game.</h2></li>
    <li> <h2>Join the Community. As much as pro gaming is about individual talent, it's also about the culture surrounding the game.</h2></li>
    <li> <h2>Make sure you're playing on the right gear, starting with a good gaming mouse, and mechanical keyboard. There are a lot of options when it comes to peripherals — varying in size, form factor, and sensitivity — but it's best to choose the one that works for you.</h2></li>
    <li> <h2>With in-game matchmaking and premium third-party matchmaking services like ESEA, its easy to find people to play against. But if you want to win, youll need to practice.</h2></li>
    <li> <h2>While the grind mentality looms large in Esports, pros must learn how to balance their practice regimen and off-screen activities. According to professional gamers we interviewed, a holistic approach to practice — including proper nutrition, exercise, and an active social life — improves mental focus and prevents burnout. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle will allow you to stay motivated for long enough to develop the skills that will ultimately attract pro organizations.</h2></li>
